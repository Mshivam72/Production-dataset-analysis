**Production Dataset Dashboard:-**

**Project Overview:-**

This project focuses on developing a dynamic Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize key metrics from a production dataset. The dashboard is designed to provide a clear overview of operational performance, production trends, and efficiency over time. It transforms raw data into insightful visual summaries, helping users make informed decisions quickly.

**Objective:-**

The primary objective of this project is to help stakeholders monitor and evaluate production data using an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard. It simplifies the data interpretation process and supports better decision-making by highlighting essential patterns and performance metrics.

**Features:-**

The dashboard presents summary cards showing total production, average output, and efficiency rate. It includes dynamic line and bar charts to display trends over selected timeframes. Users can interact with the data using slicers and filters to focus on specific time periods or production categories. Conditional formatting is applied to highlight deviations or underperformance, and the layout is designed to be clean and easy to navigate.

**Tools Used:-**

This dashboard was created entirely in Microsoft Excel. Core features were built using PivotTables and PivotCharts, combined with formulas such as SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, and IF statements. Slicers and Timeline tools were implemented for interactivity, and data validation along with named ranges ensured a smooth user experience.

**Outcome:-**

The resulting dashboard provides an effective solution for tracking production performance. It enables faster identification of trends, outliers, and inefficiencies, which supports improved planning, resource allocation, and operational strategy.
